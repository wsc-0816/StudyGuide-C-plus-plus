Please read this file first before you run anything


1: You need some tools for running any 	C++ file
1.1 : terminal, You need this window to execute all programs not only c++ but also others
     How to install terminal:

2 : Some commands for you to use:
2.1 How to execute a c++ file? 
    The c++ file ends with .cpp 
    There are two ways to run this file:
    2.1.1 : First, compile: Open your C++ file with sublime text, in the menu bar ,Click
                           Tools -> Build. Or you can use "command" + b on mac.
                           Then you can see a black icon in the file where you save the c++ file .
    2.1.2 : Second, run :  Double click the black icon you can see a terminal jump out.

    2.2.1: First compile: Open your terminal, transfer to your category where you saved c++  					   file.
    					  Use "cd  file-name-or-path" to jump to file.   
    					  eg:
    					  file-name
    					  In your terminal please type: cd Desktop 
    					  You can see the something changed with your front in your terminal
    					  path 
    					  In your terminal please type: cd Desktop/one-file-name/
    					  If you type something wrong, please use "cd  .." go back to the up level you were in.Or you can use "cd" to go back to root which is the beginning of your terminal.
    					  After finding your c++ file, and type :
    					  g++ -o  file-name file-name.cpp
    					  Then you can see a black icon.
    2.2.2 Second run: 	Still with your terminal, go to the file where your black icon is
    					Double click, or type "./file-name" in your terminal.

2.2 The difference between compile and run :
 Compile means that the computer will check your code to see if there is an bug or typo in your file.
 Run means that you want to let computer do what you want to do by coding.
